## [23.4.0] - 2023-04-17

### Added

- Log aggregation added ([#219]).
- Deploy default and support custom affinities ([#241]).
- Add the ability to loads DAG via git-sync ([#245]).
- Cluster status conditions ([#255])
- Extend cluster resources for status and cluster operation (paused, stopped) ([#257])
- Added more detailed landing page for the docs ([#260]).

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Support specifying Service type.
  This enables us to later switch non-breaking to using `ListenerClasses` for the exposure of Services.
  This change is breaking, because - for security reasons - we default to the `cluster-internal` `ListenerClass`.
  If you need your cluster to be accessible from outside of Kubernetes you need to set `clusterConfig.listenerClass`
  to `external-unstable` or `external-stable` ([#258]).
- `operator-rs` `0.31.0` -> `0.34.0` -> `0.39.0` -> `0.40.2` ([#219]) ([#257]) ([#261]).
- Specified security context settings needed for OpenShift ([#222]).
- Fixed template parsing for OpenShift tests ([#222]).
- Revert openshift settings ([#233]).
- Support crate2nix in dev environments ([#234]).
- Fixed LDAP tests on Openshift ([#254]).
- Reorganized usage guide docs([#260]).
- Set RBAC objects labels and owner ([#261])

### Removed

- Removed PVC-usage documentation ([#245]).

## [0.4.0] - 2022-06-30

## [0.3.0] - 2022-05-31

### Added

- BREAKING: Prometheus metrics enabled ([#51]); The `statsdExporterVersion` must
  be set in the cluster specification.
- Reconciliation errors are now reported as Kubernetes events ([#53]).
- Use cli argument `watch-namespace` / env var `WATCH_NAMESPACE` to specify
  a single namespace to watch ([#54]).
- Support for Airflow 2.2.4, 2.2.5 documented ([#68],[#84]).
- Support for mounting DAGs via `ConfigMap` or `PersistentVolumeClaim` ([#84]).
- Init job replaced with an AirflowDB resource created by the operator  ([#89]).
- Stabilize start-up by watching AirflowDB job ([#104]).
- Stabilize integration tests ([#109]).

### Changed

- `operator-rs` `0.10.0` -> `0.18.0` ([#53],[#54],[#89]).
- [BREAKING] Specifying the product version has been changed to adhere to [ADR018](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/contributor/adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.html) instead of just specifying the product version you will now have to add the Stackable image version as well, so `version: 3.5.8` becomes (for example) `version: 3.5.8-stackable0.1.0` ([#106])

## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-14

### Changed
- Fixed a bug in the namespace resolution for the Init job that resulted in it not being triggered in non-default
namespaces. ([#23]).

[#23]: https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/23

- Added comments about the override of configuration properties and environment variables, and added code to pass the environment variables in the custom resource to the container, as this step was missing ([#42]).

[#42]: https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/42

## [0.1.0] - 2022-02-03

### Added

- Added the initial implementation of the operator. The Init command - which takes the credentials from a secret - is required to set up the external database, and the webserver service will wait for this to be completed before declaring itself to be ready. ([#1]).
