:description: Airflow requires PostgreSQL for database support, and Redis for Celery executors.
:airflow-prerequisites: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/prerequisites.html

Airflow requires an SQL database to operate.
The {airflow-prerequisites}[Airflow documentation] specifies:

Fully supported for production usage:

* PostgreSQL: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

NOTE: The SDP Airflow images do not bundle the MySQL provider for Airflow.
If you need MySQL or MariaDB as an Airflow back-end, you will need to create a custom image to include this provider.

The Celery exectutor also requires:

* Redis (any stable version)
