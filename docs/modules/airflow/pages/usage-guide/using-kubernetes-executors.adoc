= Using Kubernetes executors
:description: Configure Kubernetes executors in Airflow to dynamically create pods for tasks, replacing Celery executors and bypassing Redis for job routing.

Instead of using the Celery workers you can let Airflow run the tasks using Kubernetes executors, where Pods are created dynamically as needed without jobs being routed through a Redis queue to the workers.

== Kubernetes Executor configuration

To achieve this, swap `spec.celeryExecutors` with `spec.kubernetesExecutors`.
E.g. you would change the following example

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  celeryExecutors:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 2
    config:
      resources:
        # ...
----

to

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  kubernetesExecutors:
    config:
      resources:
        # ...
----

== Logging

Kubernetes Executors and their respective Pods only live as long as the task they are executing.
Afterwards the Pod is immediately terminated and e.g. console output or logs are gone.

In order to persist task logs, Airflow can be configured to store its https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes/stable/kubernetes_executor.html#managing-dags-and-logs[executor logs on disk (PV)] or as described in the following section on S3.

[#s3-connection]
=== Add S3 connection in Airflow Web UI

In the Airflow Web UI, click on `Admin` -> `Connections` -> `Add a new record` (the plus).
Then enter your MinIO host and credentials as shown.

The name or connection ID is `minio`, the type is `Amazon Web Services`, the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key` are filled with the S3 credentials.
The `Extra` field contains the endpoint URL like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "endpoint_url": "http://minio.default.svc.cluster.local:9000"
}
----

=== Executor configuration

In order to configure the S3 logging, you need to add the following environment variables to the Airflow cluster definition:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-airflow-kubernetes-executor-s3-logging.yaml[]
----

Now you should be able to fetch and inspect logs in the Airflow Web UI from S3 for each DAG run.

== Store xComs objects in object storage (e.g. S3)

By default Airflow stores the xCom (cross-communications) objects in the Airflow database (often times PostgreSQL), which can cause the database to run out of disk space (especially if you have high xCom traffic).
To prevent this, you can configure Airflow to do the xCom exchange via an object store backend (such as S3) and not the database.
You can read on details in https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/xcoms.html#object-storage-xcom-backend[the official documentation].

[TIP]
====
Airflow stores the xCom objects in the Postgres table `xcom` (e.g. `airflow.public.xcom`).
You can have a look at that table to see what exactly is getting stored.

To e.g. determine the biggest xCom objects you can use
[source,sql]
----
select
	length(value) as size,
	dag_run_id,
	task_id,
	map_index,
	key,
	dag_id,
	run_id,
	"timestamp"
from xcom
order by length(value) desc limit 20;
----

*Being careful* you can also clean up the table to save space in the database.
In our testing, running `VACUUM FULL` was enough for the changes to take effect on the PostgreSQL disk.

=== Add S3 connection in Airflow Web UI

Please add an S3 connection in the Admin WebUI according to <<#s3-connection>>

=== Executor configuration

In order to configure the S3 xCom backend, you need to add the following environment variables to the Airflow cluster definition:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-airflow-kubernetes-executor-s3-xcom.yaml[]
