= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the permitted Pod disruptions for Airflow nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable the default PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), the operator writes the following PDBs:

== Schedulers
Allow only a single scheduler to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Webservers
Allow only a single webserver to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Executors
* In the case of Celery executors, allow only a single executor to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
* In the case of Kubernetes executors, don't deploy any PDB, as it's Airflows responsibility to take care of the executor Pods.
