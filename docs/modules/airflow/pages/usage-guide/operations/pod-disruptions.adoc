= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the allowed Pod disruptions for Airflow nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable our PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), we write the following PDBs:

== Schedulers
We only allow a single scheduler to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Webservers
We only allow a single webserver to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Executors
* In case you use Celery executors, we only allow a single executor to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
* In case you use Kubernetes executors, we don't deploy any PDB, as it's Airflows responsibility to take care of the executor Pods.
