= Graceful shutdown

You can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

The Airflow processes receive a `SIGTERM` signal when Kubernetes wants to terminate the Pod.
The Pod logs the received signal as shown in the log below and initiate a graceful shutdown.
After the graceful shutdown timeout runs out, and the process still did not exit, Kubernetes issues a `SIGKILL` signal.

== Scheduler

As a default, Airflow schedulers have `2 minutes` to shut down gracefully.

They use the same mechanism described above. The example log output below is from a Scheduler running the KubernetesExecutor, but the mechanism is the same for CeleryExecutor-run jobs as well.

== Webserver

As a default, Airflow webservers have `2 minutes` to shut down gracefully.

They use the same mechanism described above.

== Celery Executor

As a default, Airflow celery executors have `5 minutes` to shut down gracefully (jobs running with the KubernetesExecutor use the same shutdown mechanism but this is managed internally by Airflow).

They use the same mechanism described above.
