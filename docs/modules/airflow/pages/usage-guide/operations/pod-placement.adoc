= Pod placement

You can configure the Pod placement of the Airflow pods as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_placement.adoc[].

The default affinities created by the operator are:

1. Co-locate all the Airflow Pods (weight 20)
2. Distribute all Pods within the same role (worker, webserver, scheduler) (weight 70)
