= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

Airflow offers a web UI and an API, both are exposed by the webserver process under the `webserver` role. The Operator deploys a service called `<name>-webserver` (where `<name>` is the name of the AirflowCluster) through which Airflow can be reached.

This service can have three different types: `cluster-internal`, `external-unstable` and `external-stable`. Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the listener class is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.
