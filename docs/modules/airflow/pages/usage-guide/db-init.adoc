= Database initialization
:description: Configure Airflow DB start-up.

By default, Airflow will run database initialization routines (checking and/or creating the metadata schema and creating an admin user) on start-up.
These are idempotent and can be run every time as the overhead is minimal.
However, if these steps should be skipped, a running Airflow cluster can be patched with a resource like this to deactivate the initialization:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    dbInit: false  # <1>
----
<1> Turn off the initialization routine by setting `dbInit` to `false`

NOTE: The field `dbInit` is `true` by default to be backwards-compatible.
A fresh Airflow cluster cannot be created with this field set to `false` as this results in missing metadata in the Airflow database.
