= Log aggregation
:description: Forward Airflow logs to a Vector aggregator by configuring the ConfigMap and enabling the log agent.

The logs can be forwarded to a Vector log aggregator by providing a discovery ConfigMap for the aggregator and by enabling the log agent:

NOTE: The `task` handler is responsible for showing the task logs in the UI.
Unfortunately, the log level of the `task` handler cannot be specified.
To avoid that all logs are emitted to the UI, the log level of the `airflow.task` logger is set explicitly to `INFO`.
You can change the log level as shown below.
