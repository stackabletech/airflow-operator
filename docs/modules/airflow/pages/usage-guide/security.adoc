Secure Apache Airflow by configuring user authentication and authorization.
Airflow provides built-in user and role management, but can also connect to an LDAP server or an OIDC provider to manage users centrally instead.

== Authentication

Users need to authenticate themselves before using Airflow, and there are several ways in which this can be set up.
ï¿¼
[IMPORTANT]
.Multiple authentication methods
====
Only one authentication method is supported at a time, and in case of LDAP, only one authentication class is allowed.
This means, it is not possible to configure both LDAP and OIDC authentication methods at the same time, but *it is* possible to configure multiple OIDC classes *or* one LDAP authentication class.
====

=== Built-in user management

By default, users are manually set up in the Webserver UI.
Use the blue "+" button to create users.

=== LDAP

Airflow supports xref:concepts:authentication.adoc[user authentication] against a single LDAP server.
Set up an AuthenticationClass for the LDAP server and reference it in the Airflow Stacklet resource as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 2.10.2
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap    # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> The default role that all users are assigned to

Users that log in with LDAP are assigned to a default {airflow-access-control-docs}[role] which is specified with the `userRegistrationRole` property.

You can follow the xref:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[] tutorial to learn how to set up an AuthenticationClass for an LDAP server, as well as consulting the {crd-docs}/authentication.stackable.tech/authenticationclass/v1alpha1/[AuthenticationClass reference {external-link-icon}^].

The users and roles can be viewed as before in the Webserver UI, but the blue "+" button is not available when authenticating via LDAP:

=== [[oidc]]OpenID Connect

An OpenID Connect provider can be used for authentication.
Unfortunately, there is no generic support for OpenID Connect built into Airflow.
This means that only specific OpenID Connect providers can be configured.

IMPORTANT: Airflow deployments on the Stackable Data Platform only support {keycloak}[Keycloak].

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-oidc
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 2.10.2
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
    - authenticationClass: keycloak                       # <1>
      oidc:
        clientCredentialsSecret: airflow-keycloak-client  # <2>
      userRegistrationRole: User                          # <3>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `keycloak`
<2> The reference to the Secret containing the Airflow client credentials
<3> The default role to which all users are assigned

Users that log in with OpenID Connect are assigned to a default {airflow-access-control-docs}[role] which is specified with the `userRegistrationRole` property.

The Secret containing the Airflow client credentials:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: airflow-keycloak-client
stringData:
  clientId: airflow                    # <1>
  clientSecret: airflow_client_secret  # <2>
----

<1> The client ID of Airflow as defined in Keycloak
<2> The client secret as defined in Keycloak

A minimum client configuration in Keycloak for this example looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId": "airflow",
  "enabled": true,
  "clientAuthenticatorType": "client-secret", # <1>
  "secret": "airflow_client_secret",
  "redirectUris": [
    "*"
  ],
  "webOrigins": [
    "*"
  ],
  "standardFlowEnabled": true, # <2>
  "protocol": "openid-connect" # <3>
}
----

<1> Sets the OIDC type to confidential access type.
<2> Enables the OAuth2 "Authorization Code Flow".
<3> Enables OpenID Connect and OAuth2 support.

Further information for specifying an AuthenticationClass for an OIDC provider can be found at the xref:concepts:authentication.adoc#_oidc[concepts page].

== Authorization
The Airflow Webserver delegates the {airflow-access-control-docs}[handling of user access control] to https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html[Flask AppBuilder].

=== Webinterface
You can view, add to, and assign the roles displayed in the Airflow Webserver UI to existing users.

=== LDAP

Airflow supports assigning {airflow-access-control-docs}[Roles] to users based on their LDAP group membership, though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator.
All the users logging in via LDAP get assigned to the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole` on the AirflowCluster object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> All users are assigned to the `Admin` role

=== OpenID Connect

The mechanism for assigning roles to users described in the LDAP section also applies to OpenID Connect.
Airflow supports assigning {airflow-access-control-docs}[Roles] to users based on their OpenID Connect scopes, though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator.
All the users logging in via OpenID Connect get assigned to the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authentication[*].userRegistrationRole` on the `AirflowCluster` object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-oidc
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
    - authenticationClass: keycloak
      oidc:
        clientCredentialsSecret: airflow-keycloak-client
      userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <1>
----

<1> All users are assigned to the `Admin` role
