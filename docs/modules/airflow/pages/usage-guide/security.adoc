Secure Apache Airflow by configuring user authentication and authorization.
Airflow provides built-in user and role management, but can also connect to a LDAP server to manage users centrally instead.

== Authentication

Users need to authenticate themselves before using Airflow, and there are two ways to configure users:
The built-in user management or LDAP.

=== Built-in user management

By default, users are manually set up in the Webserver UI.
Use the blue "+" button to create users.

=== LDAP

Airflow supports xref:concepts:authentication.adoc[user authentication] via LDAP.
Set up an AuthenticationClass for the LDAP server and reference it in the Airflow Stacklet resource as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 2.9.3
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap    # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> The default role that all users are assigned to

Users that log in with LDAP are assigned to a default {airflow-access-control-docs}[role] which is specified with the `userRegistrationRole` property.

You can follow the xref:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[] tutorial to learn how to set up an AuthenticationClass for an LDAP server, as well as consulting the {crd-docs}/authentication.stackable.tech/authenticationclass/v1alpha1/[AuthenticationClass reference {external-link-icon}^].

The users and roles can be viewed as before in the Webserver UI, but the blue "+" button is not available when authenticating via LDAP:

== Authorization
The Airflow Webserver delegates the {airflow-access-control-docs}[handling of user access control] to https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html[Flask AppBuilder].

=== Webinterface
You can view, add to, and assign the roles displayed in the Airflow Webserver UI to existing users.

=== LDAP

Airflow supports assigning {airflow-access-control-docs}[Roles] to users based on their LDAP group membership, though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator.
All the users logging in via LDAP get assigned to the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole` on the AirflowCluster object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> All users are assigned to the `Admin` role
