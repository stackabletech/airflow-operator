== Authentication

Every user has to authenticate themselves before using Airflow and there are several ways of doing this.

=== Webinterface

The default setting is to view and manually set up users via the Webserver UI. Note the blue "+" button where users can be added directly:

=== LDAP

Airflow supports xref:concepts:authentication.adoc[authentication] of users against an LDAP server. This requires setting up an AuthenticationClass for the LDAP server.
The AuthenticationClass is then referenced in the AirflowCluster resource as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 2.9.3
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap    # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> The default role that all users are assigned to

Users that log in with LDAP are assigned to a default https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/access-control.html#access-control[Role] which is specified with the `userRegistrationRole` property.

You can follow the xref:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[] tutorial to learn how to set up an AuthenticationClass for an LDAP server, as well as consulting the {crd-docs}/authentication.stackable.tech/authenticationclass/v1alpha1/[AuthenticationClass reference {external-link-icon}^].

The users and roles can be viewed as before in the Webserver UI, but note that the blue "+" button is not available when authenticating against LDAP:

== Authorization
The Airflow Webserver delegates the https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/access-control.html[handling of user access control] to https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html[Flask AppBuilder].

=== Webinterface
You can view, add to, and assign the roles displayed in the Airflow Webserver UI to existing users.

=== LDAP

Airflow supports assigning https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/access-control.html#access-control[Roles] to users based on their LDAP group membership, though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator.
All the users logging in via LDAP get assigned to the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole` on the `AirflowCluster` object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: airflow.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AirflowCluster
metadata:
  name: airflow-with-ldap
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: ldap # <1>
        userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> All users are assigned to the `Admin` role
