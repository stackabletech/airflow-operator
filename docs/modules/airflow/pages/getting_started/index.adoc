:description: Get started with the Stackable Operator for Apache Airflow by installing the operator, SQL database, and Redis, then setting up and running your first DAG.

This guide gets you started with Airflow using the Stackable Operator.
It guides you through the installation of the Operator as well as an SQL database and Redis instance for trial usage, setting up your first Airflow cluster and connecting to it, and viewing and running one of the example workflows (called DAGs = Direct Acyclic Graphs).

== Prerequisites for this guide

You need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a minimum starting point the following resources are recommended for this operator:

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:
