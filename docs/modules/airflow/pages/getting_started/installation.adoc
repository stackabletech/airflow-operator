= Installation

On this page you will install the Stackable Airflow Operator and its dependencies - Postgresql and Redis - as well as the commons and secret operator which are required by all Stackable Operators.

== Dependencies

Postgresql and Redis are required by Airflow: Postgresql to store metadata about DAG runs, and Redis to schedule and/or queue DAG jobs. They are components that may well already be available for customers, in which case we treat them here as pre-requisites for an airflow cluster and hence as part of the installation process. These components will be installed using Helm. Note that specific versions are declared:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-add-bitnami-repo]
----
[source,bash]

== Stackable Operators

There are 2 ways to run Stackable Operators

1. Using xref:stackablectl::index.adoc[]

2. Using Helm

=== stackablectl

stackablectl is the command line tool to interact with Stackable operators and our recommended way to install Operators.
Follow the xref:stackablectl::installation.adoc[installation steps] for your platform.

After you have installed stackablectl run the following command to install all Operators necessary for Airflow:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=stackablectl-install-operators]
----

The tool will show

----
[INFO ] Installing commons operator
[INFO ] Installing secret operator
[INFO ] Installing airflow operator
----

TIP: Consult the xref:stackablectl::quickstart.adoc[] to learn more about how to use stackablectl. For example, you can use the `-k` flag to create a Kubernetes cluster with link:https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind].

=== Helm

You can also use Helm to install the Operators. Add the Stackable Helm repository:
[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-add-repo]
----

Then install the Stackable Operators:
[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-install-operators]
----

Helm will deploy the Operators in a Kubernetes Deployment and apply the CRDs for the Airflow cluster (as well as the CRDs for the required operators). You are now ready to deploy Apache Airflow in Kubernetes.
