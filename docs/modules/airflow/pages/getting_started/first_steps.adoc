= First steps

Once you have followed the steps in the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] section to install the Operator and its dependencies, you will now deploy a Airflow cluster and its dependencies. Afterwards you can <<_verify_that_it_works, verify that it works>> by running and tracking an example DAG.

== Setup

As we have installed the external dependencies required by Airflow (Postgresql and Redis) we can now install the Airflow cluster itself.

Supported versions for PostgreSQL and Redis can be found in the https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/prerequisites.html#prerequisites[Airflow documentation].

== Secret with Airflow credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Airflow itself. Create a file called `airflow-credentials.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/code/airflow-credentials.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-airflow-credentials]

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Airflow metadata.

`connections.celeryResultBackend` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the job metadata (in the example above we are using the same postgresql database for both).

`connections.celeryBrokerUrl` must contain the connection string to the Redis instance used for queuing the jobs submitted to the airflow worker(s).

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Airflow

An Airflow cluster is made of up three components:

- `webserver`: this provides the main UI for user-interaction
- `workers`: the nodes over which the job workload will be distributed by the scheduler
- `scheduler`: responsible for triggering jobs and persisting their metadata to the backend database

Create a file named `airflow.yaml` with the following contents:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/airflow.yaml[]
----

And apply it:

----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=install-airflow]
----

Where:

- `metadata.name` contains the name of the Airflow cluster
- the label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.version`
- `spec.celeryExecutors`: deploy workers managed by Airflow's Celery engine. Alternatively you can use `kuberenetesExectors` that will use Airflow's Kubernetes engine for worker management. For more information see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html#executor-types).
- the `spec.loadExamples` key is optional and defaults to `false`. It is set to `true` here as the example DAGs will be used when verifying the installation.
- the `spec.exposeConfig` key is optional and defaults to `false`. It is set to `true` only as an aid to verify the configuration and should never be used as such in anything other than test or demo clusters.
- the previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`

NOTE: Please note that the version you need to specify for `spec.version` is not only the version of Apache Airflow which you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For a list of available versions please check our
https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable%airflow%2Ftags[image registry].
It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available.

This will create the actual Airflow cluster.

After a while, all the Pods in the StatefulSets should be ready:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset
----

The output should show all pods ready, including the external dependencies:

----
NAME                        READY   AGE
airflow-postgresql          1/1     16m
airflow-redis-master        1/1     16m
airflow-redis-replicas      1/1     16m
airflow-scheduler-default   1/1     11m
airflow-webserver-default   1/1     11m
airflow-worker-default      2/2     11m
----

When the Airflow cluster has been created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the
browser: the webserver UI port defaults to `8080` can be forwarded to the local host:

----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]
----

== Verify that it works

The Webserver UI can now be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8080`. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

Since the examples were loaded in the cluster definition, they will appear under the DAGs tabs:

image::getting_started/airflow_dags.png[Example Airflow DAGs]

Select one of these DAGs by clicking on the name in the left-hand column e.g. `example_complex`. Click on the arrow in the top right of the screen, select "Trigger DAG" and the DAG nodes will be automatically highlighted as the job works through its phases.

Great! You have set up an Airflow cluster, connected to it and run your first DAG!

[#ingest-cmd-line]
.Alternative: Using the command line
[%collapsible]
====
If you prefer to interact directly with the API instead of using the web interface, you can use the following commands. The DAG is one of the example DAGs named `example_complex`. To trigger a DAG run via the API requires an initial extra step to ensure that the DAG is not in a paused state:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=enable-dag]

A DAG can then be triggered by providing the DAG name (in this case, `example_complex`). The response identifies the DAG identifier, which we can parse out of the JSON like this:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=run-dag]

If we read this identifier into a variable such as `dag_id` (or replace it manually in the command) we can run this command to access the status of the DAG run:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=check-dag]

Look at the xref:usage-guide/index.adoc[] to find out more about configuring your Airflow cluster and loading your own DAG files.
