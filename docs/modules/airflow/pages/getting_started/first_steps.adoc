= First steps
:description: Set up an Apache Airflow cluster using Stackable Operator, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Run and monitor example workflows (DAGs) via the web UI or command line.

Once you have followed the steps in the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] section to install the Operator and its dependencies, deploy an Airflow cluster and its dependencies.
Afterward you can <<_verify_that_it_works, verify that it works>> by running and tracking an example DAG.

== Setup

With the external dependencies required by Airflow (Postgresql and Redis) installed, install the Airflow Stacklet itself.

Supported versions for PostgreSQL and Redis can be found in the https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/prerequisites.html#prerequisites[Airflow documentation].

== Secret with Airflow credentials

Create a Secret with the necessary credentials, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Airflow itself.
Create a file called `airflow-credentials.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/code/airflow-credentials.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-airflow-credentials]

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Airflow metadata.

`connections.celeryResultBackend` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the job metadata (the example above uses the same PostgreSQL database for both).

`connections.celeryBrokerUrl` must contain the connection string to the Redis instance used for queuing the jobs submitted to the airflow executor(s).

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.

NOTE: The admin user is disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Airflow

An Airflow cluster is made up of several components, two of which are optional:

* `webserver`: this provides the main UI for user-interaction
* `executors`: the CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor nodes over which the job workload is distributed by the scheduler
* `scheduler`: responsible for triggering jobs and persisting their metadata to the backend database
* `dagProcessors`: (Optional) responsible for monitoring, parsing and preparing DAGs for processing.
If this role is not specified then the process will be started as a scheduler subprocess (Airflow 2.x), or as a standalone process in the same container as the scheduler (Airflow 3.x+)
* `triggerers`: (Optional) DAGs making use of deferrable operators can be used together with one or more triggerer processes to free up worker slots.
This deferral process is also useful for providing a measure of high availability

Create a file named `airflow.yaml` with the following contents:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/airflow.yaml[]
----

And apply it:

----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=install-airflow]
----

Where:

* `metadata.name` contains the name of the Airflow cluster.
* the product version of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.image.productVersion`.
* `spec.celeryExecutors`: deploy executors managed by Airflow's Celery engine.
Alternatively you can use `kuberenetesExectors` that use Airflow's Kubernetes engine for executor management.
For more information see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html#executor-types).
* the `spec.clusterConfig.loadExamples` key is optional and defaults to `false`.
It is set to `true` here as the example DAGs are used when verifying the installation.
* the `spec.clusterConfig.exposeConfig` key is optional and defaults to `false`. It is set to `true` only as an aid to verify the configuration and should never be used as such in anything other than test or demo clusters.
* the previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.clusterConfig.credentialsSecret`.

NOTE: The version you need to specify for `spec.image.productVersion` is the desired version of Apache Airflow.
You can optionally specify the `spec.image.stackableVersion` to a certain release like `23.11.0` but it is recommended to leave it out and use the default provided by the operator.
Check our https://oci.stackable.tech/[image registry,window=_blank] for a list of available versions. Information on how to browse the registry can be found xref:contributor:project-overview.adoc#docker-images[here,window=_blank].
It should generally be safe to simply use the latest version that is available.

This creates the actual Airflow cluster.

After a while, all the Pods in the StatefulSets should be ready:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset
----

The output should show all pods ready, including the external dependencies:

----
NAME                            READY   AGE
airflow-postgresql              1/1     16m
airflow-redis-master            1/1     16m
airflow-redis-replicas          1/1     16m
airflow-scheduler-default       1/1     11m
airflow-webserver-default       1/1     11m
airflow-celery-executor-default 1/1     11m
airflow-dagprocessor-default    1/1     11m
airflow-triggerer-default       1/1     11m
----

When the Airflow cluster has been created and the database is initialized, Airflow can be opened in the
browser: the webserver UI port defaults to `8080` can be forwarded to the local host:

----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]
----

== Verify that it works

The Webserver UI can now be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8080`. Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

Since the examples were loaded in the cluster definition, they appear under the DAGs tabs:

image::getting_started/airflow_dags.png[Example Airflow DAGs]

Select one of these DAGs by clicking on the name in the left-hand column e.g. `example_trigger_target_dag`. Click on the arrow in the top right of the screen, select "Trigger DAG" and the DAG nodes are automatically highlighted as the job works through its phases.

Great! You have set up an Airflow cluster, connected to it and run your first DAG!

[#ingest-cmd-line]
.Alternative: Using the command line
[%collapsible]
====
If you prefer to interact directly with the API instead of using the web interface, you can use the following commands. The DAG is one of the example DAGs named `example_trigger_target_dag`. To trigger a DAG run via the API requires an initial extra step to ensure that the DAG is not in a paused state:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=enable-dag]

A DAG can then be triggered by providing the DAG name (in this case, `example_trigger_target_dag`).
The response identifies the DAG identifier, which can be parse out of the JSON like this:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=run-dag]

If this identifier is stored in a variable such as `dag_id` (manually replaced in the command) you can run this command to access the status of the DAG run:
[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=check-dag]
