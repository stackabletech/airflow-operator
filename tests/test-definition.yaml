#
# These tests can run against an OpenShift cluster, provided you perform the following
# steps manually before starting them with scripts/run_tests.sh
#
# 1. Label a node in the cluster with "node=2"
#
#   kubectl label nodes <node name> node=2
#
# 2. Set the "openshift" dimension below to "true" (with quotes)
