      # Log-Endpoint Test:
      # This is executed from the Webserver as JWT keys must be present.
      # A small server is started on each worker that serves the logs on its
      # 8793 port for the Webserver: we don't use the token as that is an
      # internal implementation, but check that the endpoint is reachable,
      # indicated by a 403.
      # N.B. this behaviour is stricter in 3.1.0, whereby the "/log" suffix
      # has to be declared.
      # See https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/52581.
